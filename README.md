Hi, I'm Richard! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at [Novu](https://novu.co), where I'm building open-source infrastructure for product notifications. We make omnichannel product communication easy. Star us on [Github](https://github.com/novuhq/novu).

I previously worked at Whispir, where I built a communications workflow platform and developer tools.

I'm a keen explorer of the outdoors, and love to travel. I'm in my element when I'm in the mountains, and I'm always looking for new places to conquer.
